My first attempt at solving this problem involved using recursion and passing down the token increase and new x and y locations for each button press, essentially trying all combinations of presses until the answer was found or it was determined that there was no answer. I eventually realized that this was not going to work and ended up looking at solutions. As soon as I noticed that it was an algebra problem, I went down that route and eventually figured it out (with the help of chat gpt for the equations).

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

1. Navigate to the day you'd like to run, eg. `cd src/day1`
2. Add an `input.txt` file in the desired `day` directory. A `test.txt` file can be added for test input.
3. Run the following:

To run with `input.txt`

```bash
bun run day1.ts
```

To run with `test.txt`

```bash
bun run day1.ts --test
```

To run with any other input file

```bash
bun run day1.ts --file /path/to/file.txt
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.3. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
